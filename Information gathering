### The password of the zip file ⇒ *Capstone* (C is capital)

### Notes:

The bank website → [http://swift.bank.thereserve.loc/](http://swift.bank.thereserve.loc/)

- The SWIFT Backend system  
- facilitates transfers  
- Transfer process:  
  1. A customer makes a request that funds should be transferred and receives a transfer code.  
  2. The customer contacts the bank and provides this transfer code.  
  3. An employee with the **capturer** role authenticates to the SWIFT application and *captures* the transfer.  
  4. An employee with the **approver** role reviews the transfer details and, if verified, *approves* the transfer. This must be performed from a jump host.  
  5. Once approval for the transfer is received by the SWIFT network, the transfer is facilitated and the customer is notified.

### In scope:

- Security testing of TheReserve’s internal and external networks, including all IP ranges accessible through your VPN connection.  
- OSINT of TheReserve’s corporate website, which is exposed on the external network of TheReserve. Note: this means that **all OSINT activities should be limited to the provided network subnet** and no external-internet OSINTing is required.  
- Phishing of any of TheReserve employees.  
- Attacking the mailboxes of TheReserve employees on the WebMail host (.11).  
- Using any attack methods to complete the goal of performing the transaction between the provided accounts.

To register, you need to get in touch with the government through its e-Citizen communication portal that uses SSH for communication. Here are the SSH details provided:

| **SSH Username** | e-citizen |
|------------------|----------|
| **SSH Password** | stabilitythroughcurrency |
| **SSH IP**       | X.X.X.250 |

---

To GET your IP range → click **extend**

so we got:

1. web mail ⇒ `10.200.118.11`  
2. vpn     ⇒ `10.200.118.12`  
3. web     ⇒ `10.200.118.13`

so to connect to the SSH I use:  
- SSH IP ⇒ `10.200.118.250`

### creds:

**Username:** gteamdepi  
**Password:** RFEbnA2nlswozp-q  
**MailAddr:** gteamdepi@corp.th3reserve.loc  
**IP Range:** 10.200.118.0/24

Because we have a web server let’s try connecting on it:

1. open the `/etc/hosts` file to add the IP address of the web server

2. adding the IP address and the domain  
   ![image5](images/image%205.png) 
3. try to ping it to check the connection
