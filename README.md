Capstone Red teaming challenge

---
### Red Team Operations and Simulated Attack
#### Objective: 
Conduct a simulated attack on a network environment using red team
methodologies to test incident response capabilities.

---
##### Week 1: Planning and Reconnaissance (one person)
- Task: 
	- Develop a red team engagement plan, define attack scenarios, and
gather intelligence on the target environment.
- Deliverables: 
	- Engagement plan, reconnaissance report, defined attack
scenarios.
##### Week 2: Initial Compromise and Pivoting (two)
- Task: 
	- Exploit initial vulnerabilities to gain access, escalate privileges, and
pivot within the network.
- Deliverables: 
	- Screenshots and documentation of successful exploitation,
privilege escalation, and lateral movement.
##### Week 3: Maintaining Access and Persistence (two)
- Task: 
	- Deploy backdoors, schedule tasks, and maintain access without
detection.
- Deliverables: 
	- List of persistence mechanisms, evidence of undetected
presence.
##### Week 4: Reporting, Security Posture Improvement, and Presentation
- Task: 
	- Provide a detailed report of findings, including simulated attacker
behavior and recommendations for improving the security posture. Prepare a
presentation to summarize the engagement.
- Deliverables: 
	- Red team engagement report, improvement plan for incident
response and defense strategies. Final presentation summarizing the attack
scenarios, findings, and recommendations.
